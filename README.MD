wp Custom FAQ 🚀 (v1.6)

A lightweight WordPress plugin by 3rroronly1 that creates a customizable, accordion-style FAQ section. It replicates a specific HTML design using Bootstrap 5.3 with toggleable sections, +/− icons, and color transitions.

    Visual Editor for Questions and Answers ✍️ – GUI-based formatting: bold, italic, bullets, links, line breaks. Questions allow safe inline formatting; answers support rich content.

    Custom per-section CSS (optional) 🧩 – Add extra CSS declarations for question/answer elements from the settings page if needed.

    Shortcode Support 🔗 – Use [wp_custom_faq] in posts, pages, or widgets.

Troubleshooting 🔍

    Accordion not collapsing: Check console for errors, disable conflicting plugins, ensure Bootstrap is loaded.

    Styling issues: Ensure shortcode is in a Shortcode block, not Preformatted/Code. Clear caching/minification plugins after updates.

    Spacing lost in questions when formatting: the plugin preserves whitespace using CSS. If needed, add a space around formatted text or use a non-breaking space (&nbsp;).
